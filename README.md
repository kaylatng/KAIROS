## INTRODUCTION

_Description from canvas assignment._ This project's goal is to make a CCCG (Casual Collectable Card Game), or 3CG for short, core gameplay loop. Bits and pieces have been taken from games like Hearthstone, Smash Up, Nova Island, and Dfiance. The theme is Greek Mythology.

## IMPLEMENTATION

For programming patterns and feedback, see https://github.com/kaylatng/CMPM121-3CG (since this assignment did not ask to include these elements).
